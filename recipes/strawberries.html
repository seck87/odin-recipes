    <h2>Description</h2>    
    <p>This is the simplest version of chocolate covered strawberries I know. 
        Paraffin was originally used instead of shortening. Turn the strawberries upside 
        down and insert by the toothpicks into a piece of styrofoam for easy cooling, or 
        simply place them on a sheet of wax paper. White chocolate may be drizzled over the 
        milk chocolate for a fancier look. They are perfect for weddings when decorated with 
        frosting bow ties, bells, butterflies, roses, etc.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces milk chocolate chips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons shortening</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh strawberries with leaves</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a double boiler, melt the chocolate and shortening, stirring occasionally 
            until smooth. Holding them by the toothpicks, dip the strawberries into the 
            chocolate mixture.</li>
        <li>Insert toothpicks into the tops of the strawberries.</li>
        <li>Turn the strawberries upside down and insert the toothpick 
            into styrofoam for the chocolate to cool.</li>

    </ol>
